he world is the planet Earth and all life on it, i
ncluding human civilization.[1] In a philosophical co
ntext, the "world" is the whole of the physical Universe,
 or an ontological world (the "world" of an individual). 
In a theological context, the world is the material or the profane sphere,
 as opposed to the celestial, spiritual, transcendent or sacred spheres. 
"End of the world" scenarios refer to the end of human history, 
often in religious contexts.

The history of the world is commonly understood as
 spanning the major geopolitical developments of 
about five millennia, from the first civilizations to
 the present. In terms such as world religion, world 
language, world government, and world war, 
the term world suggests an international or 
intercontinental scope without necessarily implying 
participation of every part of the world.

The world population is the sum of all human populations 
at any time; similarly, the world economy is the sum of t
he economies of all societies or countries, especially
 in the context of globalization. Terms such as "world championship", 
"gross world product", and "world flags" imply the sum or combination of all 
sovereign states.
